                whish until well combined.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a

                tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired.</li>
            <li>Leg pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2 -4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta.
                Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as needed. serve immediately topped with additional parmesan
                and parsley.</li>
